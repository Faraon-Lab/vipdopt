# Project Description
To be updated.

# Folder Structure
This section will give basic descriptions of the software workflow and what is stored where.

- configs: in configs we define every single thing that can be configurable and can be changed in the future. Good examples are training hyperparameters, folder paths, the model architecture, metrics, flags.
- evaluation: is a collection of code that aims to evaluate the performance and accuracy of our model.
- executor `[`UNUSED`]`: ~~in this folder, we usually have all the functions and scripts that train the model or use it to predict something in different environments. And by different environments I mean: executors for GPUs, executors for distributed systems. This package is our connection with the outer world and it’s what our “main.py” will use.~~
- model `[`UNUSED`]`: ~~: contains the actual deep learning code (we talk about tensorflow, pytorch etc)~~
- trials: contains past trials with all the save data necessary to reconstruct (permittivity data, config etc.)
- utils: utilities functions that are used in more than one places and everything that don’t fall in on the above come here.
